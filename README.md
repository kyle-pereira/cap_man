Cap Man Game Project

This is a project i've been working on to try and understand how to use javascript and the HTML5 canvas
to make a game. It is sort of like a Pac-man version of a traditional platformer. The little guy jumps
around and grabs coins. He has powerups, etc., etc. There is also a random level generation, which makes
it more interesting. It isn't really a big project or something like that. I just thought of something
crazy to implement an HTML5 canvas on to learn how to use it.
